PePMDT: Personalized Progressive Mechanistic Digital Twin for Liver Regeneration

PePMDT is a deep learning-based framework that integrates mechanistic mathematical modeling with gene expression analysis to predict donor-specific liver regeneration after Living Donor Liver Transplantation (LDLT). This project leverages deep learning to identify gene expression patterns and utilizes a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) to map these patterns to dynamic liver recovery simulations, enabling precise post-surgical monitoring and forecasting.

Key Features:
•	Deep Learning for gene expression analysis
•	Mechanistic Model Simulation for patient-specific liver recovery trajectories
•	Gene Expression Integration by mapping transcriptomic data to a mechanistic model using FNN
•	Predictive Analytics for post-surgical outcomes in LDLT donors
